# Overview

This is a game of simple collecting. As blocks fall from the top of the screen, you catch them to earn points.
The commands are simple:
LEFT: Left arrow
RIGHT: Right arrow:
UP: Up arrow
DOWN: Down arrow
'Q': Quit

This was the first Python Arcade game I've created. I wanted to create something simple that would help me familiarize
myself with how the engine works, and learn the basics of game development.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to be my editor/complier and imported the arcade library for the game development

Language: Python
Libraries: Arcade, random

# Future Work

* I would like to be able to add the character animation so he changes direction, and make it look like he's moving.
* I would like to add additional levels that increase difficulty, like adding platforms and such
* I would like to add enemies that would make it so there's some problem solving involved.
